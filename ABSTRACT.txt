Abstract:

This artifact supports the evaluation of a new demand-driven algorithm for
efficient circular Reference Attribute Grammar evaluation, specifically designed
to improve performance in higly circular applications, e.g., dataflow analyses
for Java. The artifact includes all necessary tools, dependencies, benchmarks, and scripts to
reproduce the experiments presented in the corresponding paper. It provides a
Docker-based setup for easy deployment, as well as detailed instructions for
manual installation. The artifact allows users to explore and validate the
proposed algorithm's performance improvements through real-world case studies,
demonstrating significant speedups in dead-assignment and null-pointer
dereference analyses compared to existing algorithms.
While the artifact does not require specific hardware,
reproducing the experiments as described in the paper may take one to two days
of computation time. The artifact has been tested on Linux and macOS, ensuring
broad compatibility and ease of use.
